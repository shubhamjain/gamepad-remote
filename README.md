# Gamepad Remote

> Use your Gamepad Controller to control media on your PC.

Have a wireless controller lying around? Repurpose it for triggering media actions: play/pause, seek, and control volume. 

**Note**: Gamepad Remote works by mapping your controller buttons to keyboard keys. The media actions are not universal, but  work on most major sites/media players (Netflix, Youtube, VLC et. al). The mapping of buttons is based on [XBox Wireless Controller](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/xbox-xbox-one-wireless-controller-white-tf5-00001/10450316.aspx). 

| Gamepad Button  | Media Action | Keyboard key mapping  |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| A  | Play/pause   | Spacebar   |
| Right/Left Arrow  | Seek   | Right/Left Arrow  |
|  Up/Down Arrow |  Vol Control  |  Up/Down Arrow |
