# Gamepad Remote

> Use your Gamepad Controller to control media on your PC.

Have a wireless controller like this lying around? Use it to remotely control your PC: play/pause, seek, and control volume. 

**Note**: Gamepad remote maps your controller button to keyboard keys. The media actions are not universal but do work on major sites/media players (Netflix, Youtube, VLC et. al). Here's the list of mapping. 

| Gamepad Button  | Media Action | Keyboard key mapping  |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| A  | Play/pause   | Spacebar   |
| Right/Left Arrow  | Seek   | Right/Left Arrow  |
|  Up/Down Arrow |  Vol Control  |  Up/Down Arrow |
